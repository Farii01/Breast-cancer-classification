# Breast-cancer-classification
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras

The Breast Cancer dataset is particularly valuable for binary classification tasks, as it includes two distinct folders: one for malignant (cancer) samples and another for benign (negative) samples. The model used to classify is a CNN architecture for image classification tasks. It starts with a series of convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling layers to extract features and reduce spatial dimensions. The model uses rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions to introduce non-linearity. After several convolutional and max-pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a vector. 
This code defines suitable model for binary classification problems where the goal is to classify input images into one of two classes (e.g., cancerous or non-cancerous).
